Objective :
Our objective is to assemble a web app that helps educate people to learn more about their potential neighborhood. For example, learning the neighborhood’s Affordability, Job Availability, school’s education system and the crime rates.
Goal : 
To build a web app that lessons the hassle of people moving to new neighborhoods.

Inspiration:
Our Inspiration was that one of our team members had recently moved to a new town. At that time, they didn't know neighborhood as well and was looking for the cheapest option. However, little did they know it wasn't the best option. Throughout the years, they were flooded with drunkards in front of their house in the middle of the night. Seemingly, their taxes were put to waste; the streets were filled with holes; the schools district weren't the finest.  
How we built it:
We used HTML/CSS in order to develop the structure of the site while giving the touch of JS in order to make it work more remotely.  We used the API from Google Cloud Platform in order for the users to use map on our website regarding what neighborhood they are satisfied with.

Challenges we ran into:
 
We ran into a couple of challenges as due to lack of knowledge regarding html/css/js languages and using github.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

 
What we learned:

-Learning new coding languages

-Familiarize ourselves for the first time with Htmls, css,  and java script to create language.

-Came to appreciate the usefulness of github 

What's next for Know Your Neighborhood:
-More locations

-More Statistical Data

-Expand accessibility
